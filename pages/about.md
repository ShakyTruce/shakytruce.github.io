## About the Project

The purpose of this project is to tell a story of local activism in Starkville, Mississippi. The fight for African American equal rights was not just relegated to Little Rock, Arkansas, Birmingham, Alabama, or Oxford, Mississippi, but was also fought on the streets and in the schools of every southern town during the Jim Crow era. Local individuals organized and protested against inequality and fought for integration, equal employment, and their right to vote. Their voices deserve to be heard, and their contributions to the larger civil rights narrative demands recognition.

“A Shaky Truce” highlights the civil rights struggles that took place in Starkville, Mississippi during the 1960s and 70s, a time when local African Americans demanded equality for all citizens. This website is designed to tell that story, providing information for scholars and tools for teachers interested in exploring these local conversations about race, equality, and human rights.

The content you see in this website is a result of ongoing research that began in 2014.  Photos and documents are from Mississippi State University Libraries’ Special Collections, Digital Collections, or Circulating Collections; others come from other online archives; still other items were generously donated or shared by those we interviewed.  If you are interested in further research on this or related topics, visit lib.msstate.edu for help getting started.
